### What I learned

Discovered that multiple background images can be placed within a background tag, with locations that can be moved with the following snippet along with a seperate background color.

body { 
    background: url(/images/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg), var(--cc-dark-cyan-);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right 40vw top -75vh, left 40vw top 47vh;
    overflow: hidden;
    }
